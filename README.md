# Kanye Admin  
A Lightweight Administrative System for Roblox (Deprecated)

Kanye Admin is a minimal, command-driven administrative framework originally designed for Roblox Jump Map environments. It was created to provide essential moderation capabilities for servers that lacked established solutions such as Coles or HD Admin.

The system focuses on delivering only the core features required for effective server management, prioritizing low overhead, fast execution, and a straightforward command structure. While simple in design, Kanye Admin served as a practical and efficient tool for communities that needed reliable administrative functionality without additional dependencies.

## Purpose
- Developed to fill the administrative gap in Jump Map servers without Coles or HD Admin.
- Offers essential, performance-focused commands with minimal system load.
- Provides an accessible, lightweight alternative for quick deployment and ease of use.

## Project Status
Kanye Admin is no longer under active development and is maintained solely as an archived project. Although updates have ceased, the system remains as a reference to its original design philosophy—delivering practical solutions built from immediate community needs.

## Legacy
Kanye Admin was not intended to be a comprehensive administrative suite, but rather a functional, targeted tool created to address real-time issues within Jump Map communities. Despite its deprecation, it reflects an important period in the server ecosystem where lightweight, purpose-built administration tools were essential.
